            <p>
                This website exists as a redirect from www.justinschaaf.com to justinschaaf.com.
                When I was configuring justinschaaf.com v3, I was running into some issues with
                HTTPS and having a CNAME record of "www" redirect to the apex domain. As a simple
                solution, I made this website which should automatically redirect users to the apex 
                domain.
